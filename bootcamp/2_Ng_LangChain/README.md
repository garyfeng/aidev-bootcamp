# Notebooks for Andrew Ng's LangChain Course

The notebooks under this folder is a fork of https://github.com/ksm26/LangChain-for-LLM-Application-Development, which itself is a recreation of the notebooks used in Andrew Ng's course [LangChain for LLM Application Development](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/langchain-for-llm-application-development/).

The content was forked on 7/3/2023 from the above repo. Notebooks are further modified to use both OpenAI API key and Azure OpenAI Service API key. 

The original README.md file is renamed [README_ksm26.md]
