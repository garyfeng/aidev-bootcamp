# Notebooks for Andrew Ng's ChatGPT Prompt Engineering Course

The notebooks under this folder is a fork of https://github.com/LazaUK/DeepLearningAI-ChatGPT-PromptEngineering, which itself is a recreation of the notebooks used in Andrew Ng's course [ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/).

The content was forked on 7/3/2023 from the above repo. Notebooks are further modified to use both OpenAI API key and Azure OpenAI Service API key. 

The original README.md file is renamed [README_LazaUK.md]
