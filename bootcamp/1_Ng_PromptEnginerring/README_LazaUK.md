# ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers

Andrew Ng and Isa Fulford's released great course called ["ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers"](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/) on DeepLearning.AI site.

I've followed on-screen instructions to re-create their practical Jupyter notebooks and then adapted the code to run against Azure OpenAI service, as it has slightly different syntax in comparison to the original OpenAI endpoints:
1. Guidelines for Prompting;
2. Iterative Prompt Development;
3. Summarising Prompt Content;
4. Inferring Sentiment and Topics;
5. Transforming (Language Translation, Spellcheck, Tone Adjustment, Format Conversion);
6. Expanding (Customised eMails based on Sentiment);
7. Chatbot.
